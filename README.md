## About The Project
  
HackersNewsFeed was designed to deliver a seamless news feed experience with offline access. Users can view articles downloaded during the last session when offline, ensuring continuous access to information. Articles are displayed in a scrollable view, sorted by date, and can be opened in an in-app web view for easy reading.
  
The app includes intuitive swipe-to-delete functionality, allowing users to remove articles from the list, and ensuring deleted articles do not reappear upon data refresh. A dedicated favorites feature enables users to mark and access their favorite articles from a separate screen. Additionally, users can access a deleted articles view to see and manage previously removed content..
